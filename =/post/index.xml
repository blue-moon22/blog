      <description>This is a nice and easy project if you need to back up lots of data automatically from your workspace - in my case genomic data from an HPC cluster I wanted to back-up locally in case of disaster. I had an old raspberry pi lying around and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d put it to good use. The benefits of using a raspberry pi instead of a laptop or PC is you can just leave your raspberry pi on and let it do its thing.</description>

      <description>On 13th July, Dr Simone Ecker, Research Associate from the UCL Cancer Institute presented her research for the Women in Computing Seminar Series. Simone talked about epigenetics and how she uses bioinformatics to answer questions on DNA methylation and gene expression variability in human blood cells.
It was a full-house and Simone&amp;rsquo;s talk was well-received, generating lots of discussion about how variability is overlooked across many disciplines of statistics.
To read about her research, check out UCL&amp;rsquo;s recent news story on her work.</description>

      <title>What is my PhD?</title>

      <description>Realised I haven&amp;rsquo;t said much on the PhD front. Rotations are now over, and I&amp;rsquo;m currently drafting the PhD project. What I can be sure of is it contains many &amp;lsquo;omes&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;omics&amp;rsquo;&amp;hellip;
Here&amp;rsquo;s a sneak peak at what I&amp;rsquo;ll be looking at:
1) Analysis of metagenomic data of microbes in the oral cavity. Basically all the microbes&amp;rsquo; DNA in a mouth..
2) Mobilome (funnier said aloud). Lots of mobile genetic elements, the genes that move across microbes:</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Linux</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally found the time to install Linux! (I&amp;rsquo;m ashamed it&amp;rsquo;s taken this long.)
Installing Ubuntu Alongside Windows 8.1 I used this fantastic installation guide, courtesy of Gary Newell, plus a few tricks of the trade specific to my battered (but well-loved) Acer Aspire laptop.
Installing any operating system boils down to these basic steps (which is explained in detail in the tutorial):
Back-up or be sorry&amp;hellip; I created a Disk Image of Windows 8.</description>

      <title>Hidden Markov Models</title>

      <description>Hidden Markov models here, there and everywhere! Here’s a short and sweet description of a Hidden Markov model used to generate a short DNA sequence, and accompanying R code.
Brief rundown of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) The nucleotides are basically the letters that make up a DNA sequence: “A”, “T”, “G” and “C”. In a sequence generated by the Markov Model, the probability of finding a nucleotide (or letter) at a particular position in a sequence depends on the nucleotide found at the previous position.</description>

      <title>R-Ladies Researchers &amp; Students Community Launch</title>

      <description>Last week, I gave a bioinformatics talk and workshop for the launch event of R-Ladies London&amp;rsquo;s new Researchers and Students Community. R-Ladies is a world-wide organisation to promote gender diversity in the R community. The R-Ladies London branch has been running for just over a year, and have been providing workshops (in R, Github) for beginners to advanced level.
The R-Ladies community and attendees of these events are mainly gender minorities from research and academia.</description>
