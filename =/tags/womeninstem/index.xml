      <description>On 13th July, Dr Simone Ecker, Research Associate from the UCL Cancer Institute presented her research for the Women in Computing Seminar Series. Simone talked about epigenetics and how she uses bioinformatics to answer questions on DNA methylation and gene expression variability in human blood cells.
It was a full-house and Simone&amp;rsquo;s talk was well-received, generating lots of discussion about how variability is overlooked across many disciplines of statistics.
To read about her research, check out UCL&amp;rsquo;s recent news story on her work.</description>
