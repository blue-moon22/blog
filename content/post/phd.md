title: What is my PhD?

Realised I haven't said much on the PhD front. Rotations are now over, and I'm
currently drafting the PhD project.
What I can be sure of is it <strong>contains many 'omes' and 'omics'...</strong>

Here's a sneak peak at what I'll be looking at:

1) Analysis of metagenomic data of microbes in the oral cavity. Basically all the microbes' DNA in a mouth..

2) Mobilome (funnier said aloud). Lots of mobile genetic elements, the genes
that move across microbes:

3) Resistome. Lots of anti-microbial & antibiotic resistance in bacteria (and fungi!)

4) Maybe some genome-scale metabolic models, which are all the metabolic reactions
in a microbial cell. Here's an example from [Goyel et al.](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2014/mb/c3mb70421a)

It's ambitious.. time for some more refining!
