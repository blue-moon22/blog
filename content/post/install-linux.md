I've finally found the time to install Linux! (I'm ashamed it's taken this long.)

### Installing Ubuntu Alongside Windows 8.1
I used this fantastic [installation guide](https://www.lifewire.com/ultimate-windows-8-1-ubuntu-dual-boot-guide-2200654), courtesy of [Gary Newell](http://www.everydaylinuxuser.com/), plus a few tricks of the trade specific to my battered (but well-loved) Acer Aspire laptop.

Installing any operating system boils down to these basic steps (which is explained in detail in the tutorial):

#### Back-up or be sorry...
I created a Disk Image of Windows 8.1 on USB and a Recovery DVD, with the hope of never having to use them.
Disasters happen because every machine has it's own quirk. Imagine losing your Windows OS while installing Linux and then having to buy a new Windows license. Whoops!

(Spoilers: I didn't need these in the end, lucky me)


#### Partitioning
In layman terms, partitioning for Linux is basically creating some space on your hard drive for you to install Linux and for it to run smoothly by shrinking the space where you run Windows. Luckily, Windows 8 onwards already has an easy-to-use Disk Management application for that

#### Install Ubuntu on a USB and try..
Potentially much troubleshooting and Googling at this stage. First trying to run Linux from the USB from the boot menu, then the inevitable error messages, Google it, fix it etc. I got off relatively lightly here. If this was my first exposure to installing Linux, I'd be naive to think installing it on everything was easy peasy. Not true.

#### Ubuntu running, now install..
Now a Linuxer!
