Last week, I gave a bioinformatics talk and workshop for the launch event of R-Ladies London's new Researchers and Students Community.

R-Ladies is a world-wide organisation to promote gender diversity in the R community. The R-Ladies London branch has been running for just over a year, and have been providing workshops (in R, Github) for beginners to advanced level.

The R-Ladies community and attendees of these events are mainly gender minorities from research and academia. In response to the demand for more research-focussed workshops, the Researchers and Students Community was set up. The goal is to create a space for gender minorities to learn from each other in a supportive environment, and to celebrate their achievements in research.

We hope to have our next workshop mid/end May. We welcome proposals for future talks and workshops from gender minorities. This could be anything from collection of big data through to analysis techniques.

If you are interested in attending or talking at future events, please check out the [meet-up group](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-london/) and follow us [@RLadiesLondon](https://twitter.com/RLadiesLondon)
