On 13th July, Dr Simone Ecker, Research Associate from the UCL Cancer Institute presented
her research for the Women in Computing Seminar Series. Simone talked about epigenetics
and how she uses bioinformatics to answer questions on DNA methylation and gene expression
variability in human blood cells.

It was a full-house and Simone's talk was well-received, generating lots of discussion
about how variability is overlooked across many disciplines of statistics.

To read about her research, check out [UCL's recent news story on her work](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/cancer/news/variability-key-mechanism-behind-adaptability-immune-cells).

I am planning to organise a seminar each month, with the next one being mid-August.
